![mk1](./img/mark1/mk1.jpeg)

## Introdution

Phemla (PHoton EMitting LAntern) is a solar rechargable and not a so portable lantern. Perfect for camping activities ⛺.

## Story

The idea and the original design was developed and sketched by a Scout group.

## Goals

![oh](./img/open-source-hardware-logo.png)

Make this project as much open source possible, starting from CAD to CAE files.

Design wins:

- Overall part count is very low
- The parts are easy to fabricate (possible machining processes)
- The machine is easy to assemble
- Maximizing usage of materials like glass and wood

## Iterations history

### Mark 1

First version. It was used a power bank with usb-c for recharging purpouse and usb-a for withdraw necessary output for the LEDs. Solar cells are not used in this stage.

### Mark 2

Improved version. It was added a solar module.

### Mark 3

Still in under development.

## Design FIles

| Iteration   | ZIP files              |
| ----------- | -----------            |

## To do

- Add design files
Reduce number of screws
- Improve plexiglass fixing or laternative solutions
- Use standard 5mm LEDs instead of using SMD components (more user-friendly)
- Rotate 90° usbc feedthrough
- Reduce costs (mostly derivative by PCB design)
- Reduce overall dimensions
